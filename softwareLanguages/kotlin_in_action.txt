Biggest advantage of Kotlin is how is its interoperability with Java

Chapter 1: What and Why

(1.1, 1.2)

data class Person(val name: String,                | 'data' class
	val age: Int? = null) 		           | nullable type (Int?): default value
       
fun main(args: Array<String>) {                    | top-level function
	val persons = listOf(Person("Alice"),      | 
		Person("Bob", age = 29))           | named argument

	val oldest = persons.maxBy { it.age ?: 0 } | lambda expression, Elvis op

	println("The oldest one is: $oldest)       | string template
}

// The oldest person is: Person(name=Bob, age=29)  | auto generated toString()


Omitting Alices age uses the default value of null, the Elvis operator subs
Her age for 0 and therefore Bob wins with age 29 > 0

The primary goal of Kotlin is to provide a more concise, more productive, safer
alternative to Java that’s suitable in all contexts where Java is used today

The most common areas to use Kotlin are these:
Building server-side code (typically, backends of web applications)
Building mobile applications that run on Android devices

Just like Java, Kotlin is a statically typed programming language.

On the other hand, in contrast to Java, Kotlin doesn’t require you to specify the type
of every variable explicitly in your source code. In many cases, the type of a variable can
automatically be determined from the context, allowing you to omit the type declaration.


For ex:

val x = 1;

You’re declaring a variable, and because it’s initialized with an integer value, Kotlin automatically determines that its type is Int.

Kotlin’s supports nullable types, which lets you
write more reliable programs by detecting possible null pointer exceptions at compile
time.

Kotlin lets you program in the functional style but doesn’t enforce it.

The Kotlin language, including the compiler, libraries, and all related tooling, is entirely
open source and free to use for any purpose.

(1.3, 1.4)

Server-side programming is a fairly broad concept. It encompasses all of the following
types of applications and much more:
Web applications that return HTML pages to a browser
Backends of mobile applications that expose a JSON API over HTTP
Microservices that communicate with other microservices over an RPC protocol

fun renderPersonList(persons: Collection<Person>) =
	createHTML().table {                              | 1
		for (person in persons)                   | 2
			{ tr {                            | 1
				td { +person.name }       | 1
				td { +person.age }        | 1
			}
		}
	}
}

1: functions that map html to tags
2: a regular Kotlin loop

As you can see, you can easily combine functions that map to HTML tags and regular
Kotlin language constructs. You no longer need to use a separate template language, with
a separate syntax to learn, just to use a loop when generating a page of HTML.


Another case where you can use Kotlin’s clean, concise DSLs is persistence
frameworks. For example, the Exposed framework
4 provides an easy way to read DSL
for describing the structure of an SQL database and performing queries entirely from
Kotlin code, with full type checking.

object CountryTable : IdTable() {
	val name = varchar("name", 250).uniqueIndex()
	val iso = varchar("iso", 2).uniqueIndex()
}

1

class Country(id: entityID) : Entity(id)
	{ var name: String by
	CountryTable.name var iso: String by
	CountryTable.iso
}

2

val russia = Country.find
	{ CountryTable.iso.eq("ru") }.first()

3

1: Describes a table in the database
2: Creates a class corresponding to a database entity
3: You can query this database using pure Kotlin code

Common development tasks, such as adding listeners to controls
or binding layout elements to fields, can be accomplished with much less code, or
sometimes with no code at all (the compiler will generate it for you). The Anko library (
https://github.com/kotlin/anko), also built by the Kotlin team, improves your experience
even further by adding Kotlin-friendly adapters around many standard Android APIs.

verticalLayout {
	val name = editText()                            | 1
	button("Say Hello") {                            | 2 
		onClick { toast("Hello, ${name.text}!" } | 3
	}
}

1: creates a simple text field
2: when click the button displays the value of the text field
3: concise API's for attaching a listener and showing a toast

Kotlin strives to remove the
NullPointerException from your program. Kotlin’s type system tracks values that can
and can’t be null and forbids operations that can lead to a NullPointerException at
runtime. The additional cost required for this is minimal: marking a type as nullable takes
only a single character, a question mark at the end:

val s: String? = null    | 1
val s2: String = ""      | 2

1: maybe be null
2: may not be null



Another type of exception that Kotlin helps avoid is the ClassCastException. It
happens when you cast an object to a type without first checking that it has the right type. In Java, developers often leave out the check, because the type name must be repeated in
val s: String? = null
val s2: String = ""
the check and in the following cast. In Kotlin, on the other hand, the check and the cast
are combined into a single operation: once you’ve checked the type, you can refer to
members of that type without any additional casts. Thus, there’s no reason to skip the
check, and no chance to make an error. Here’s how this works:

if (value is String)                    | 1
	println(value.toUpperCase())    | 2

1: check the type
2: uses the method of the type


(1.5 1.6)


Kotlin source code is normally stored in files with the extension .kt. The Kotlin compiler
analyzes the source code and generates .class files, just like the Java compiler does. The
generated .class files are then packaged and executed using the standard procedure for the
type of application you’re working on. In the simplest case, you can use the kotlinc
command to compile your code from the command line and use the java command to
execute your code:

kotlinc <source file or directory> -include-runtime -d <jar name>
java -jar <jar name>


Chapter 2: Kotlin basics

(2.1 2.2)

smart casts: combine a type check and a cast into one operation

fun main(args: Array<String>)
	{ println("Hello, world!")
}

This is hello world in Kotlin

The fun keyword is used to declare a function. Programming in Kotlin is lots of fun, indeed!

The parameter type is written after the parameter name. This applies to variable
declarations as well, as you’ll see later. 

The function can be declared at the top level of a file; you don’t need to put it in a class. 

Arrays are just classes. Unlike Java, Kotlin doesn’t have a special syntax for declaring
array types. 

You write println instead of System.out.println. The Kotlin standard library
provides many wrappers around standard Java library functions, with more concise
syntax, and println is one of them. 

You can omit the semicolon from the end of a line, just as in many other modern
languages.

fun max(a: Int, b: Int): Int
	{ return if (a > b) a else
	b
}


>>> println(max(1, 2))
2


The function declaration starts with the fun keyword, followed by the function name:
max, in this case. It’s followed by the parameter list in parentheses. The return type
comes after the parameter list, separated from it by a colon

In Kotlin, if is an expression, not a statement

val question = "The Ultimate Question of Life, the Universe, and Everything"
val answer = 42

This example omits the type declarations, but you can also specify the type explicitly
if you want to:

val answer: Int = 42


val answer: Int
answer = 42

The compiler can’t infer the type if you give no information about the values that can
be assigned to this variable.

val (from value)—Immutable reference. A variable declared with val can’t be
reassigned after it’s initialized. It corresponds to a final variable in Java.

var (from variable)—Mutable reference. The value of such a variable can be changed. This declaration corresponds to a regular (non-final) 

fun main(args: Array<String>) {
	val name = if (args.size > 0) args[0] else "Kotlin"
	println("Hello, $name!")
}

String template example, you can escape the $ if you need it to show up

You can also use an expression instead of a variable name by using the ${} notation

/* Java */
public class Person {
	private final String name;
	public Person(String name)
		{ this.name = name;
	}
	public String getName()
		{ return name;
	}
}

/* Kotlin */

class Person(val name: String)

Getters and constructors implicitly initialized

In Kotlin, public is the default visibility, so you can omit it

class Person(
	val name: String,         | 1
	var isMarried: Boolean    | 2
)

1: read only, generates field and a trivial getter
2: writable property, a field, a getter and a setter

class Rectangle(val height: Int, val width: Int)
	{ val isSquare: Boolean
	get() {
		return height == width
	}
}

Example of custom getter

Every Kotlin file can have a
package statement at the beginning, and all declarations (classes, functions, and
properties) defined in the file will be placed in that package

Declarations defined in
other files can be used directly if they’re in the same package; they need to be imported if
they’re in a different package. As in Java, import statements are placed at the beginning
of the file and use the import keyword.

Kotlin doesn’t make a distinction between importing classes and methods, and it
allows you to import any kind of declaration using the import keyword.

In most cases, however, it’s still a good practice to follow Java’s directory layout and
to organize source files into directories according to the package structure. Sticking to
that structure is especially important in projects where Kotlin is mixed with Java, because
doing so lets you migrate the code gradually without introducing any surprises


(2.3 2.4)

In this section, we’re going to talk about the when construct. It can be thought of as a
replacement for the switch construct in Java, but in fact it’s more powerful and is used
much more often. Along the way, we’ll give you an example of declaring enums in
Kotlin and discuss the concept of smart casts.

enum class Color {
	RED, ORANGE, YELLOW, GREEN, BLUE, INDIGO, VIOLET
}

This is a rare case when a Kotlin declaration uses more keywords than the
corresponding Java one: enum class versus just enum in Java. In Kotlin, enum is a
so-called soft keyword: it has a special meaning when it comes before class, but you can
use it as a regular name in other places. On the other hand, class is still a keyword, and
you’ll continue to declare variables named clazz or aClass

enum class Color(
	val r: Int, val g: Int, val b: Int                          | 1
) {
	RED(255, 0, 0), ORANGE(255, 165, 0),                        | 2
	YELLOW(255, 255, 0), GREEN(0, 255, 0), BLUE(0, 0, 255),
	INDIGO(75, 0, 130), VIOLET(238, 130, 238);                  | 3
	fun rgb() = (r * 256 + g) * 256 + b                         | 4
}
>>> println(Color.BLUE.rgb())
255


1: Declares properties of enum constants
2: Specifies property values when each constant is created
3: The semicolon here is required.
4: Defines a method on the enum class

Note that this example shows the
only place in the Kotlin syntax where you’re required to use semicolons: if you define
any methods in the enum class, the semicolon separates the enum constant list from the
method definitions.

Like if, when is an expression that returns a value, so you can write a function with
an expression body, returning the when expression directly. When we talked about
functions at the beginning of the chapter, we promised an example of a multiline function
with an expression body. Here’s such an example:

fun getMnemonic(color: Color) =           | 1
	when (color) {                    | 2
		Color.RED -> "Richard"
		Color.ORANGE -> "Of"
		Color.YELLOW -> "York"
		Color.GREEN -> "Gave"
		Color.BLUE -> "Battle"
		Color.INDIGO -> "In"
		Color.VIOLET -> "Vain"
	}
>>> println(getMnemonic(Color.BLUE))
Battle

1: Returns a when expression directly
2: Returns the corresponding string if the color equals the enum constant

The code finds the branch corresponding to the passed color value. Unlike in Java, you don’t need to write break statements in each branch (a missing break is often a
cause for bugs in Java code). If a match is successful, only the corresponding branch is
executed. You can also combine multiple values in the same branch if you separate them with
commas:

fun getWarmth(color: Color) = when(color)
	{ Color.RED, Color.ORANGE, Color.YELLOW ->
	"warm" Color.GREEN -> "neutral"
	Color.BLUE, Color.INDIGO, Color.VIOLET -> "cold"
}
>>> println(getWarmth(Color.ORANGE))
warm

The when construct in Kotlin is more powerful than Java’s switch. Unlike switch, which requires you to use constants (enum constants, strings, or number literals) as
branch conditions, when allows any objects. Let’s write a function that mixes two colors
if they can be mixed in this small palette. You don’t have lots of options, and you can
easily enumerate them all:

fun mix(c1: Color, c2: Color) =
	when (setOf(c1, c2)) {                        | 1
		setOf(RED, YELLOW) -> ORANGE          | 2
		setOf(YELLOW, BLUE) -> GREEN
		setOf(BLUE, VIOLET) -> INDIGO
	else -> throw Exception("Dirty color")        | 3
}
>>> println(mix(BLUE, YELLOW))
GREEN

1: An argument of the when expression can be any object. It’s checked for equality
with the branch conditions.
2: Enumerates pairs of colors that can be mixed
3: Executed if none of the other branches were matched

When without an argument

fun mixOptimized(c1: Color, c2: Color) =
	when {
		(c1 == RED && c2 == YELLOW) ||
		(c1 == YELLOW && c2 == RED) ->
		ORANGE
		(c1 == YELLOW && c2 == BLUE) ||
		(c1 == BLUE && c2 == YELLOW) ->
		GREEN
		(c1 == BLUE && c2 == VIOLET) ||
		(c1 == VIOLET && c2 == BLUE) ->
		INDIGO
		else -> throw Exception("Dirty color")
	}
>>> println(mixOptimized(BLUE, YELLOW))
GREEN

If no argument is supplied for the when expression, the branch condition is any
boolean expression

To mark that a class implements an interface, you use
a colon (:) followed by the interface name:

interface Expr
class Num(val value: Int) : Expr                       | 1
class Sum(val left: Expr, val right: Expr) : Expr      | 2

1: Simple value object class with one property, value, implementing the Expr
interface
2: The argument of a Sum operation can be any Expr: either Num or another Sum

In Kotlin, you check whether a variable is of a certain type by using an is check. If
you’ve programmed in C#, this notation should be familiar. The is check is similar to
instanceof in Java

Both if and when can have blocks as branches. In this case, the last expression in the
block is the result. If you want to add some logging to the example function, you can do
so in the block and return the last value as before:

fun evalWithLogging(e: Expr): Int =
	when (e) {
		is Num -> {
			println("num: ${e.value}")
			e.value
		}
		is Sum -> {
			val left = evalWithLogging(e.left)
			val right = evalWithLogging(e.right)
			println("sum: $left + $right")
			left + right
		}
		else -> throw IllegalArgumentException("Unknown expression")
	}


To replace the most common use cases of for loops, Kotlin
uses the concepts of ranges.

for (i in 1..100) {
 // this will happen 100x
}

for (i in 100 downTo 1 step 2) {
 // this allows you to go down, step determines how much you subtract each time
}

The .. syntax also works for characters and not only numbers

For ex: i in "A" .. "F"

You use the in operator to check whether a value is in a range, or its opposite, !in, to
check if a value isn’t in a range. Here’s how you can use
belongs to a range of characters:

fun isLetter(c: Char) = c in 'a'..'z' || c in 'A'..'Z'

fun isNotDigit(c: Char) = c !in '0'..'9'
>>> println(isLetter('q'))
true
>>> println(isNotDigit('x'))
true

Ranges aren’t restricted to characters, either. If you have any class that supports
comparing instances (by implementing the java.lang.Comparable interface), you can
create ranges of objects of that type.

(2.5)

Exceptions in Kotlin

if (percentage !in 0..100) {
	throw IllegalArgumentException(
		"A percentage value must be between 0 and 100: $percentage")
}

As with all other classes, you don’t have to use the new keyword to create an instance
of the exception

Unlike in Java, in Kotlin the throw construct is an expression and can be used as a
part of other expressions

val percentage =
	if (number in 0..100)
		number
	else
		throw IllegalArgumentException(
			"A percentage value must be between 0 and 100: $number")

Just as in Java, you use the try construct with catch and finally clauses to handle
exceptions

fun readNumber(reader: BufferedReader): Int?              | 1
	{ try {
		val line = reader.readLine()
		return Integer.parseInt(line)
	}
	catch (e: NumberFormatException).                 | 2
		{ return null
	}
	finally {                                         | 3
		reader.close()
	}
}
>>> val reader = BufferedReader(StringReader("239"))
>>> println(readNumber(reader))
239


1: You don’t have to explicitly specify exceptions that can be thrown from this
function
2: The exception type is on the right
3: finally works just as it does in Java.

The biggest difference from Java is that the throws clause isn’t present in the code: if
you wrote this function in Java, you’d explicitly write throws IOException after the
function declaration.

Just like many other modern JVM languages, Kotlin doesn’t differentiate between
checked and unchecked exceptions.

fun readNumber(reader: BufferedReader)
	{ val number = try {
		Integer.parseInt(reader.readLine())               | 1
	} catch (e: NumberFormatException)
		{ return
	}
	println(number)
}
>>> val reader = BufferedReader(StringReader("not a number"))

>>> readNumber(reader)                                            | 2

1: Becomes the value of the try expression
2: Nothing is printed

Chapter 3: Defining and calling functions

(3.1 3.2)


Creating a set

val set = setOf(1, 7, 53)

You create a list or a map in a similar way

val list = listOf(1, 7, 53)
val map = mapOf(1 to "one", 7 to "seven", 53 to "fifty-three")

Note that to is not a special construct, but a normal function. 
We’ll return to it later in the chapter

>>> println(set.javaClass)
class java.util.HashSet
>>> println(list.javaClass)
class java.util.ArrayList
>>> println(map.javaClass)
class java.util.HashMap

javaClass is Kotlin’s equivalent of Java’s getClass().

Kotlin doesn’t have its own set of collection classes. All of your
existing knowledge about Java collections still applies here. Why are there no Kotlin collections? Because using the standard Java collections
makes it much easier to interact with Java code. You don’t need to convert collections
one way or the other when you call Java functions from Kotlin or vice versa.

Even though Kotlin’s collections are exactly the same classes as Java collections, you
can do much more with them in Kotlin. For example, you can get the last element in a list
or find a maximum in a collection of numbers:

>>> val strings = listOf("first", "second", "fourteenth")
>>> println(strings.last())
fourteenth
>>> val numbers = setOf(1, 14, 2)
>>> println(numbers.max())
14

>>> val list = listOf(1, 2, 3)
>>> println(list)                 | 1
[1, 2, 3]

1: invokes toString()

fun <T> joinToString(
	collection: Collection<T>,
	separator: String,
	prefix: String,
	postfix: String
): String {
	val result = StringBuilder(prefix)
	for ((index, element) in collection.withIndex()) {
		if (index > 0) result.append(separator)         | 1
		result.append(element)
	}
	result.append(postfix)
	return result.toString()
}


1: Don’t append a separator before the first element.

joinToString(collection, " ", " ", ".")

Not very readable

joinToString(collection, separator = " ", prefix = " ", postfix = ".")

Much better

When calling a method written in Kotlin, you can specify the names of some
arguments that you’re passing to the function. If you specify the name of an argument in
a call, you should also specify the names for all the arguments after that, to avoid
confusion

Warning
Unfortunately you can’t use named arguments when calling methods
written in Java,

In Kotlin, you can often avoid creating overloads because you can specify default
values for parameters in a function declaration. Let’s use that to improve the
joinToString function. For most cases, the strings can be separated by commas without
any prefix or postfix. So, let’s make these values the defaults:

fun <T> joinToString(
	collection: Collection<T>,
	separator: String = ", ",
	prefix: String = "",
	postfix: String = ""
): String

Now you can either invoke the function with all the arguments or omit some of them

>>> joinToString(list, ", ", "", "")
1, 2, 3
>>> joinToString(list)
1, 2, 3
>>> joinToString(list, "; ")
1; 2; 3

When using the regular call syntax, you can omit only trailing arguments. If you use
named arguments, you can omit some arguments from the middle of the list and specify
only the ones you need:

>>> joinToString(list, prefix = "# ")
# 1, 2, 3

We all know that Java, as an object-oriented language, requires code to be written as
methods of classes

As a result, you end up with classes that don’t contain any state or any instance
methods and that act as containers for a bunch of static methods

In Kotlin, you don’t need to create all those meaningless classes. Instead, you can
place functions directly at the top level of a source file, outside of any class

Let’s put the joinToString function into the strings package directly. Create a file
called join.kt with the following contents:

package strings
fun joinToString(...): String { ... }

let’s look at the Java
code that would compile to the same class:

/* Java */
package strings;
public class JoinKt {
	public static String joinToString(...) { ... }
}


You can see that the name of the class generated by the Kotlin compiler corresponds
to the name of the file containing the function. All top-level functions in the file are
compiled to static methods of that class. Therefore, calling this method from Java is as
easy as calling any other static method:

/* Java */
import strings.JoinKt;
...
JoinKt.joinToString(list, ", ", "", "");

To change the name of the generated class that contains Kotlin top-level
functions, you add a @JvmName annotation to the file. Place it at the
beginning of the file, before the package name:

@file:JvmName("StringFunctions")
package strings
fun joinToString(...): String { ... }

Now the function can be called as follows:

/* Java */
import strings.StringFunctions;
StringFunctions.joinToString(list, ", ", "", "");

By default, top-level properties, just like any other properties, are exposed to Java
code as accessor methods (a getter for a val property and a getter/setter pair for a var
property). If you want to expose a constant to Java code as a public static final
field, to make its usage more natural, you can mark it with the const modifier (this is
allowed for properties of primitive types, as well as String):

const val UNIX_LINE_SEPARATOR = "\n"

This gets you the equivalent of the following Java code:

/* Java */
public static final String UNIX_LINE_SEPARATOR = "\n";

(3.3 3.4)

Conceptually, an extension function is a simple thing: it’s a function that can be called
as a member of a class but is defined outside of it

To demonstrate that, let’s add a
method for computing the last character of a string



package strings

fun String.lastChar(): Char = this.get(this.length - 1)


As you can see, all you need to do is put the name of the class or interface that you’re
extending before the name of the function you’re adding. This class name is called the
receiver type, and the value on which you’re calling the extension function is called the
receiver object

In this case String is the receiver type and 'this' is referencing the receiver object

You can call the function using the same syntax you use for ordinary class members

>>> println("Kotlin".lastChar())
n

In a sense, you’ve added your own method to the String class. Even though String
isn’t part of your code

In the body of an extension function, you use this as you’d use it in a method. And, as in a regular method, you can omit it:

package strings

fun String.lastChar(): Char = get(length - 1)

Using implicit 'this'

Unlike methods defined in the class, extension functions don’t have access to private or protected members of the class.

When you define an extension function, it doesn’t automatically become available across
your entire project. Instead, it needs to be imported, just like any other class or function. This helps avoid accidental name conflicts

import strings.lastChar
val c = "Kotlin".lastChar()

You can change the name of the class or function you’re importing using the as
keyword

import strings.lastChar as last
val c = "Kotlin".last()

Method overriding in Kotlin works as usual for member functions, but you can’t override
an extension function.

In the previous section, you defined a function lastChar. Now let’s convert it into a
property

val String.lastChar: Char
	get() = get(length - 1)


when you need to access an extension property from Java, you should
invoke its getter explicitly: StringUtilKt.getLastChar("Java")


The vararg keyword, allows you to declare a function taking an arbitrary number
of arguments

An infix notation lets you call some one-argument functions without ceremony

Destructuring declarations allow you to unpack a single composite value into
multiple variables

When you call a function to create a list, you can pass any number of arguments to it:

val list = listOf(2, 3, 5, 7, 11)

If you look up how this function is declared in the library, you’ll find the following:

fun listOf<T>(vararg values: T): List<T> { ... }

One other difference between Kotlin and Java is the syntax of calling the function
when the arguments you need to pass are already packed in an array. In Java, you pass
the array as is, whereas Kotlin requires you to explicitly unpack the array. Technically, this feature is called using a spread operator, but in practice it’s as simple as putting the * character before the corresponding argument:

fun main(args: Array<String>) {
	val list = listOf("args: ", *args)
	println(list)
}

To create maps, you use the mapOf() function:

val map = mapOf(1 to "one", 7 to "seven", 53 to "fifty-three")

This is a good time to provide another explanation we promised you at the beginning
of the chapter. The word to in this line of code isn’t a built-in construct, but rather a
method invocation of a special kind, called an infix call

In an infix call, the method name is placed immediately between the target object
name and the parameter, with no extra separators. The following two calls are equivalent:

1.to("one")
1 to "one"

Infix calls can be used with regular methods and extension functions that have one
required parameter.

"The split() method in Java
doesn’t work on a dot." It’s a common trap to write "12.345-6.A".split(".") and to
expect an array [12, 345-6, A] as a result. But Java’s split method returns an empty
array! That happens because it takes a regular expression as a parameter, and it splits a
string into several strings according to the expression.


Kotlin hides the confusing method and provides as replacements several overloaded extensions named split that have different arguments

Here’s how you’d split the string by either a dot or a dash:

>>> println("12.345-6.A".split("\\.|-".toRegex()))
[12, 345, 6, A]

This creates a regular expression explicitly



>>> println("12.345-6.A".split(".", "-"))
[12, 345, 6, A]

This specifies several delimiters without using a regex

fun parsePath(path: String) {
	val directory = path.substringBeforeLast("/")
	val fullName = path.substringAfterLast("/")
	val fileName = fullName.substringBeforeLast(".")
	val extension = fullName.substringAfterLast(".")
	println("Dir: $directory, name: $fileName, ext: $extension")
}
>>> parsePath("/Users/yole/kotlin-book/chapter.adoc")
Dir: /Users/yole/kotlin-book, name: chapter, ext: adoc

Here’s how the same task can be done using regular expressions:

fun parsePathRegexp(path: String) {
	val regex = """(.+)/(.+)\.(.+)""".toRegex()
	val matchResult = regex.matchEntire(path)
	if (matchResult != null) {
		val (directory, filename, extension) = matchResult.destructured
		println("Dir: $directory, name: $filename, ext: $extension")
	}
}

In this example, the regular expression is written in a triple-quoted string. In such a
string, you don’t need to escape any characters, including the backslash

The purpose of triple-quoted strings is not only to avoid escaping characters. Such a
string literal can contain any characters, including line breaks. That gives you an easy
way to embed in your programs text containing line breaks. As an example, let’s draw
some ASCII art:

val kotlinLogo = """| //
		   .|//
		   .|/ \"""
>>> println(kotlinLogo.trimMargin("."))
| //
|//
|/ \

Let’s see how to use local functions to fix a fairly common case of code duplication.

class User(val id: Int, val name: String, val address: String)
	fun saveUser(user: User) {
	if (user.name.isEmpty()) {
		throw IllegalArgumentException(
			"Cannot save user ${user.id}: Name is empty")
	}
	if (user.address.isEmpty()) { 
		throw IllegalArgumentException(
			"Cannot save user ${user.id}: Address is empty")
	}
	// Save user to the database
}
>>> saveUser(User(1, "", ""))
java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: Cannot save user 

The amount of duplicated code here is fairly small, and you probably won’t want to
have a full-blown method in your class that handles one special case of validating a user. But if you put the validation code into a local function, you can get rid of the duplication
and still maintain a clear code structure. Here’s how it works:

class User(val id: Int, val name: String, val address: String)

fun saveUser(user: User) {
	fun validate(user: User,
			value: String,
			fieldName: String) {
		if (value.isEmpty()) {
			throw IllegalArgumentException(
			"Cannot save user ${user.id}: $fieldName is empty")
		}
	}
	validate(user, user.name, "Name")
	validate(user, user.address, "Address")
	// Save user to the database
}

local functions have access to all parameters and
variables of the enclosing function.

Therefore we can do this:

fun saveUser(user: User) {
	fun validate(value: String, fieldName: String) {
		if (value.isEmpty()) {
			throw IllegalArgumentException(
			"Cannot save user ${user.id}: $fieldName is empty")
		}
	}
	validate(user.name, "Name")
	validate(user.address, "Address")
	// Save user to the database
}

To improve this example even further, you can move the validation logic into an
extension function of the User class:

class User(val id: Int, val name: String, val address: String)

fun User.validateBeforeSave() {
	fun validate(value: String, fieldName: String)
		{ if (value.isEmpty()) {
			throw IllegalArgumentException(
				"Can't save user $id: empty $fieldName")
		}
	}
	validate(name, "Name")
	validate(address, "Address")
}

fun saveUser(user: User)
	{ user.validateBeforeSave
	()
	// Save user to the database
}


Extracting a piece of code into an extension function turns out to be surprisingly
useful. Even though User is a part of your codebase and not a library class, you don’t
want to put this logic into a method of User because it’s not relevant to any other places
where User is used.



Chapter 4: Classes, Objects, and Interfaces

(4.1 4.2)

Declaring a
class as a data class instructs the compiler to generate several standard methods for this
class.

object keyword that declares a class and also
creates an instance of the class.

The keyword is used to express singleton objects, companion objects, and object expressions

We’ll begin with a look at defining and implementing interfaces. Kotlin interfaces are
similar to those of Java 8: they can contain definitions of abstract methods as well as
implementations of non-abstract methods (similar to the Java 8 default methods), but
they can’t contain any state

To declare an interface in Kotlin, use the interface keyword instead of class:

interface Clickable
	{ fun click()
}

Here’s how you implement the interface:

class Button : Clickable {
	override fun click() = println("I was clicked")
}

Kotlin uses the colon after the class name to replace both the
implements keywords used in Java

The override modifier, similar to the @Override annotation in Java, is used to mark
methods and properties that override those from the superclass or interface. Unlike Java, using the override modifier is mandatory in Kotlin. This saves you from accidentally
overriding a method if it’s added after you wrote your implementation; your code won’t
compile unless you explicitly mark the method as override or rename it.

Let’s change the
Clickable interface by adding a method with a default implementation

interface Clickable {
	fun click()
	fun showOff() = println("I'm clickable!")
}

Let’s suppose now that another interface also defines a showOff method and has the
following implementation for it:

interface Focusable {
	fun setFocus(b: Boolean) =
		println("I ${if (b) "got" else "lost"} focus.")
	fun showOff() = println("I'm focusable!")
}

What happens if you need to implement both interfaces in your class? Each of them
contains a showOff method with a default implementation; which implementation wins?
Neither one wins. Instead, you get the following compiler error if you don’t implement
showOff explicitly:

The class Button must override public open fun showOff() because it
inherits many implementations of it

The Kotlin compiler forces you to provide your own implementation:

class Button : Clickable, Focusable {
	override fun click() = println("I was clicked")

	override fun showOff() {
		super<Clickable>.showOff()
		super<Focusable>.showOff()
	}
}

Whereas Java’s classes and methods are open by
default, Kotlin’s are final by default.

If you want to allow the creation of subclasses of a class, you need to mark the class
with the open modifier. In addition, you need to add the open modifier to every property
or method that can be overridden

open class RichButton : Clickable {
	fun disable() {}
	open fun animate() {}
	override fun click() {}
}

Note that if you override a member of a base class or interface, the overriding
member will also be open by default. If you want to change this and forbid the subclasses
of your class from overriding your implementation, you can explicitly mark the
overriding member as final:

open class RichButton : Clickable
	{ final override fun click() {}
}

"final" isn’t redundant here because "override" without "final" implies being
"open"

First we’ll look at the syntax
of declaring the primary constructor and initializer blocks, and then we’ll explain how to
declare several constructors

a simple class:

class User(val nickname: String)

Normally, all the declarations in a class go inside curly braces. You may wonder why
this class has no curly braces and instead has only a declaration in parentheses. This
block of code surrounded by parentheses is called a primary constructor. It serves two
purposes: specifying constructor parameters and defining properties that are initialized by
those parameters


This is equivalent	

class User constructor(_nickname: String)
	{ val nickname: String
	
	init {
		nickname = _nickname
	}
}

In this example, you see two new Kotlin keywords: constructor and init. The
constructor keyword begins the declaration of a primary or secondary constructor. The
init keyword introduces an initializer block

The underscore in the constructor parameter _nickname serves to distinguish the
name of the property from the name of the constructor parameter.

You can declare default values for constructor arguments just as you can for function
arguments


class User(val nickname: String,
	val isSubscribed: Boolean = true)

To create an instance of a class, you call the constructor directly, without the new
keyword:

>>> val alice = User("Alice")
>>> println(alice.isSubscribed)
true
>>> val bob = User("Bob", isSubscribed = false)
>>> println(bob.isSubscribed)
false

If all the constructor parameters have default values, the compiler
generates an additional constructor without parameters that uses
all the default values. That makes it easier to use Kotlin with
libraries that instantiate classes via parameterless constructors.

If your class has a superclass, the primary constructor also needs to initialize the
superclass. You can do so by providing the superclass constructor parameters after the
superclass reference in the base class list:

open class User(val nickname: String) { ... }
class TwitterUser(nickname: String) : User(nickname) { ... }

If you don’t declare any constructors for a class, a default constructor that does
nothing will be generated for you:

open class Button

If you inherit the Button class and don’t provide any constructors, you have to
explicitly invoke the constructor of the superclass even if it doesn’t have any parameters:

class RadioButton: Button()

If you want to ensure that your class can’t be instantiated by other code, you have to
make the constructor private

class Secretive private constructor() {}

Alternatively, you can declare it in a more usual way in the body of the class:

class Secretive {
	private constructor()
}




open class View
	{ constructor(ctx: Context)
	{
		// some code
	}
	constructor(ctx: Context, attr: AttributeSet) {
	// some code
	}
}

This class doesn’t declare a primary constructor (as you can tell because there are no
parentheses after the class name in the class header), but it declares two secondary
constructors. A secondary constructor is introduced using the
You can declare as many secondary constructors as you need. constructor keyword.

If you want to extend this class, you can declare the same constructors:

class MyButton : View
	{ constructor(ctx:
	Context)
		: super(ctx) {
		// ...
	}
	constructor(ctx: Context, attr: AttributeSet)
		: super(ctx, attr) {
	// ...
	}
}

Here you define two constructors, each of which calls the corresponding constructor
of the superclass using the super() keyword.

Just as in Java, you also have an option to call another constructor of your own class
from a constructor, using the this() keyword

class MyButton : View {
	constructor(ctx: Context): this(ctx, MY_STYLE) {
		// ...
	}
	constructor(ctx: Context, attr: AttributeSet): super(ctx, attr) {
		// ...
	}
}

In Kotlin, an interface can contain abstract property declarations.

interface User {
	val nickname: String
}



class PrivateUser(override val nickname: String) : User

class SubscribingUser(val email: String) : User {
	override val nickname: String
	get() = email.substringBefore('@')
}

class FacebookUser(val accountId: Int) : User
	{ override val nickname =
	getFacebookName(accountId)
}

>>> println(PrivateUser("test@kotlinlang.org").nickname)
test@kotlinlang.org
>>> println(SubscribingUser("test@kotlinlang.org").nickname)
test

You’ve seen a few examples of two kinds of properties: properties that store values and
properties with custom accessors that calculate values on every access. Now let’s see
how you can combine the two and implement a property that stores a value and provides
additional logic that’s executed when the value is accessed or modified.

class User(val name: String) {
	var address: String = "unspecified"
	set(value: String) {
		println("""
			Address was changed for $name:
			"$field" -> "$value".""".trimIndent())
		field = value
	}
}
>>> val user = User("Alice")
>>> user.address = "Elsenheimerstraße 47, 80687 München"
Address was changed for Alice:
"unspecified" -> "Elsenheimerstraße 47, 80687 München".

class LengthCounter
	{ var counter: Int =
	0
		private set
	fun addWord(word: String)
		{ counter +=

	}
}

You can’t change set outside of the class.

(4.3 4.4)

As is the case in Java, all Kotlin classes have several methods you may want to override:
toString(), equals(), and hashCode(). Let’s look at what these methods are and how
Kotlin can help you generate their implementations automatically

class Client(val name: String, val postalCode: Int)
	{ override fun equals(other: Any?): Boolean {
		if (other == null || other !is Client)
			return false
	return name == other.name &&
		postalCode == other.postalCode
	}
	override fun toString() = "Client(name=$name, postalCode=$postalCode)"
}


Here we override the common methods, equals, and toString

"Any" is the analogue of java.lang.Object: a superclass of all classes in Kotlin. The
nullable type "Any?" means "other" can be null.

Checks whether "other" is a Client

Checks whether the corresponding properties are equal

Just to remind you, the is check in Kotlin is the analogue of instanceof in Java.

The hashCode method should be always overridden together with equals

Let’s create a set with one element: a client named Alice. When you check whether
this set contains the client with the same name and postal code, you consider such objects
to be equal, but the set doesn’t contain it:

>>> val processed = setOf(Client("Alice", 342562))
>>> println(processed.contains(Client("Alice", 342562)))
false

The reason is that the Client class is missing the hashCode method. Therefore, it
violates the general hashCode contract: if two objects are equal, they must have the same
hash code.

To fix that, you can add the implementation of hashCode() to the class:

class Client(val name: String, val postalCode: Int) {
	...
	override fun hashCode(): Int = name.hashCode() * 31 + postalCode
}

If you want your class to be a convenient holder for your data, don’t forget to override
these methods: toString, equals, and hashCode. If you add
the modifier data to your class, all the necessary methods are automatically generated
for you:

data class Client(val name: String, val postalCode: Int)

This will automatically override hashCode, equals and toString

Also in Kotlin you can compare objects with == it'll default to using .equals

To make it even easier to use data classes as immutable objects, the Kotlin compiler
generates one more method for them: a method that allows you to copy the instances of
your classes, this will create a deep copy of the object

You can also pass values to copy if you want to change properties

A common problem in the design of large object-oriented systems is fragility caused by
implementation inheritance. When you extend a class and override some of its methods, your code becomes dependent on the implementation details of the class youre extending

The design of Kotlin recognizes this problem and treats classes as final by default.

Whenever you’re implementing an interface, you can say that you’re delegating
the implementation of the interface to another object, using the by keyword. Here’s how
you can use this approach to rewrite the previous example:

class DelegatingCollection<T>(
	innerList: Collection<T> = ArrayList<T>()
) : Collection<T> by innerList {}

Delegates the Collection implementation to innerList


As you can see, all the method implementations in the class are gone. The compiler
will generate them, and the implementation is similar to that in the
DelegatingCollection example

Now, when you need to change the behavior of some methods, you can override
them, and your code will be called instead of the generated methods.



The object keyword comes up in Kotlin in a number of cases, but they all share the
same core idea: the keyword defines a class and creates an instance:

-Object declaration is a way to define a singleton.
 
-Companion objects can contain factory methods and other methods that are related to this
class but don’t require a class instance to be called. Their members can be accessed via
class name. 

-Object expression is used instead of Java’s anonymous inner class


object declaration
feature. The object declaration combines a class declaration and a declaration of a single
instance of that class.

object Payroll {
	val allEmployees = arrayListOf<Person>()

	fun calculateSalary() {
		for (person in allEmployees) {
		...
		}
	}
}

Just like a class, an object declaration can contain declarations of properties, methods, initializer blocks, and so on. The only things that aren’t allowed are constructors (either
primary or secondary)

Unlike instances of regular classes, object declarations are created
immediately at the point of definition, not through constructor calls from other places in
the code.

And just like a variable, an object declaration lets you call methods and access
properties by using the object name to the left of the . character:

Payroll.allEmployees.add(Person(...))
Payroll.calculateSalary()

You can also declare objects in a class.

data class Person(val name: String) {
	object NameComparator : Comparator<Person> {
		override fun compare(p1: Person, p2: Person): Int =
			p1.name.compareTo(p2.name)
	}
}
>>> val persons = listOf(Person("Bob"), Person("Alice"))
>>> println(persons.sortedWith(Person.NameComparator))
[Person(name="Alice"), Person(name="Bob")]

Companion objects: a place for factory methods and static members

A companion object is a regular object that is declared in a class

Classes in Kotlin can’t have static members; Java’s static keyword isn’t part of the
Kotlin language. As a replacement, Kotlin relies on package-level functions (which can
replace Java’s static methods in many situations) and object declarations (which replace
Java static methods in other cases, as well as static fields).

if you need to write a function that can be called
without having a class instance but needs access to the internals of a class, you can write
it as a member of an object declaration inside that class. An example of such a function
would be a factory method

One of the objects defined in a class can be marked with a special keyword, companion. If you do that, you gain the ability to access the methods and properties of
that object directly through the name of the containing class, without specifying the name
of the object explicitly

class A {
	companion object
		{ fun bar() {
			println("Companion object called")
		}
	}
}
>>> A.bar()
Companion object called


class User {
	val nickname: String

	constructor(email: String) {
		nickname = email.substringBefore('@')
	}

	constructor(facebookAccountId: Int) {
		nickname = getFacebookName(facebookAccountId)
	}
}

These are Secondary constructors

An alternative approach to express the same logic, which may be beneficial for many
reasons, is to use factory methods to create instances of the class

class User(val nickname: String)
	{ companion object {
		fun newSubscribingUser(email: String) =
			User(email.substringBefore('@'))

		fun newFacebookUser(accountId: Int) =
			User(getFacebookName(accountId))
	}
}

You can invoke the methods of companion object via the class name

>>> val subscribingUser = User.newSubscribingUser("bob@gmail.com")
>>> val facebookUser = User.newFacebookUser(4)
>>> println(subscribingUser.nickname)
bob

Factory methods are very useful. They can be named according to their purpose, as
shown in the example

For example, you can ensure that every email corresponds to a unique User
instance, and return an existing instance instead of a new one when the factory method is
called with an email that’s already in the cache. But if you need to extend such classes, using several constructors may be a better solution, because companion object members
can’t be overridden in subclasses

// business logic module
class Person(val firstName: String, val lastName: String) {
	companion object {
	}
}

// client/server communication module
fun Person.Companion.fromJSON(json: String): Person {
...
}
val p = Person.fromJSON(json)

Declares an empty companion object
Declares an extension function

Chapter 5: lambdas

(5.1 5.2)

Lambdas are pieces of code that can be passed around like a variable

>>> val people = listOf(Person("Alice", 29), Person("Bob", 31))
>>> println(people.maxBy { it.age })
Person(name=Bob, age=31)

In this example we are passing maxBy to the printLn function

If a lambda just delegates to a method or property, it can be replaced by a member
reference

people.maxBy(Person::age)

Here's the basic layout of a lambda expression

{ x: Int, y: Int -> x + y }

Parameters -> body

A lambda expression in Kotlin is always surrounded by curly braces. Note that there
are no parentheses around the arguments. The arrow separates the argument list from the
body of the lambda

You can store a lambda expression in a variable and then treat this variable like a
normal function (call it with the corresponding arguments):

>>> val sum = { x: Int, y: Int -> x + y }
>>> println(sum(1, 2))
3

If you want to, you can call the lambda expression directly:

>>> { println(42) }()
42

But such syntax isn’t readable and doesn’t make much sense (it’s equivalent to
executing the lambda body directly). If you need to enclose a piece of code in a block, you can use the library function run that executes the lambda passed to it:

>>> run { println(42) }
42

We can re write our oldest person function into this: 

people.maxBy({ p: Person -> p.age })

In Kotlin, a syntactic
convention lets you move a lambda expression out of parentheses if it’s the last argument
in a function call

people.maxBy() { p: Person -> p.age }

When the lambda is the only argument to a function, you can also remove the empty
parentheses from the call:

people.maxBy { p: Person -> p.age }

We can also infer the type 

people.maxBy { p: Person -> p.age }
people.maxBy { p -> p.age }

In the first we explicitly declare the p is a Person, in the second it is implied

There are cases when the compiler can’t infer the lambda parameter type. The simple rule you can follow is to always start without the
types; if the compiler complains, specify them.


With lambdas, you can refer to
parameters and local variables of that method from inside the class.

what if the code that you need to pass as a parameter is already defined as a function?

In Kotlin, just like in Java 8, you can do so if you convert the function to a value. You
use the :: operator for that:

val getAge = Person::age

This expression is called member reference, and it provides a short syntax for creating
a function value that calls exactly one method or accesses a property. A double colon
separates the name of a class from the name of the member you need to reference

This is a more concise expression of a lambda that does the same thing:

val getAge = { person: Person -> person.age }


The filter and map functions form the basis for manipulating collections

Another common task is checking whether all elements in a collection match a certain
condition (or, as a variation, whether any elements match). In Kotlin, this is expressed
through the all and any functions. The count function checks how many elements
satisfy the predicate, and the find function returns the first matching element

The groupBy function can divide all elements into different groups according to some
quality.

The flatMap function does two things: at first it transforms (or maps) each element
to a collection according to the function given as an argument, and then it combines (or
flattens) several lists into one

You may think of flatMap when you’re stuck with a collection of collections of
elements that have to be combined into one. Note that if you don’t need to transform
anything and just need to flatten such a collection, you can use the flatten function:
listOfLists.flatten().

(5.3 5.4)


In the previous section, you saw several examples of chained collection functions, such
as map and filter. These functions create intermediate collections eagerly, meaning the
intermediate result of each step is stored in a temporary list. Sequences give you an
alternative way to perform such computations that avoids the creation of intermediate
temporary objects.

Here’s an example:

people.map(Person::name).filter { it.startsWith("A") }

The Kotlin standard library reference says that both filter and map return a list. That means this chain of calls will create two lists: one to hold the results of the filter
function and another for the results of map. This isn’t a problem when the source list
contains two elements, but it becomes much less efficient if you have a million. To make this more efficient, you can convert the operation so it uses sequences
instead of using collections directly:

people.asSequence()
	.map(Person::name)
	.filter { it.startsWith("A") }
	.toList()

This converts the initial collection to Sequence, Sequences support the same API as collections.

This example will then convert the resulting Sequence back into a list

This second example wont create intermediate holding data structures

You can convert any collection to a sequence by calling the extension method
asSequence. You call toList for backward conversion.

Operations on a sequence are divided into two categories: intermediate and terminal. An
intermediate operation returns another sequence, which knows how to transform the
elements of the original sequence. A terminal operation returns a result, which may be a
collection, an element, a number, or any other object that’s somehow obtained by the
sequence of transformations of the initial collection

Sequence.map { ... }.filter { ... } .toList()

Here toList is the terminal operation

Intermediate operations are always lazy. Look at this example, where the terminal
operation is missing:

>>> listOf(1, 2, 3, 4).asSequence()
... .map { print("map($it) "); it * it }
... .filter { print("filter($it) "); it % 2 == 0 }

Executing this code snippet prints nothing to the console

>>> listOf(1, 2, 3, 4).asSequence()
... .map { print("map($it) "); it * it }
... .filter { print("filter($it) "); it % 2 == 0 }
... .toList()
map(1) filter(1) map(2) filter(4) map(3) filter(9) map(4) filter(16)

The terminal operation causes all the postponed computations to be performed

In this case, map and filter were the postponed computations

For
sequences, all operations are applied to each element sequentially: the first element is
processed (mapped, then filtered), then the second element is processed, and so on

So careful when using collections vs sequences

When working with a collection the entire collection will be transformed first

The previous examples used the same method to create a sequence: you called
asSequence() on a collection. Another possibility is to use the generateSequence()
function. This function calculates the next element in a sequence given the previous one. For example, here’s how you can use generateSequence() to calculate the sum of all
natural numbers up to 100:

>>> val naturalNumbers = generateSequence(0) { it + 1 }
>>> val numbersTo100 = naturalNumbers.takeWhile { it <= 100 }
>>> println(numbersTo100.sum())
5050

All the delayed operations are performed when the result "sum" is obtained.

Note that naturalNumbers and numbersTo100 in this example are both sequences
with postponed computation. The actual numbers in those sequences won’t be evaluated
until you call the terminal operation (sum in this case).

You can pass a lambda to any Java method that expects a functional interface. For
example, consider this method that takes a lambda as a parameter:

/* Java */
void postponeComputation(int delay, Runnable computation);

In Kotlin, you can invoke it and pass a lambda as a parameter. The compiler will
automatically convert it into an instance of Runnable:

postponeComputation(1000) { println(42) }

Note that when we say "an instance of Runnable," what we mean is "an instance of
an anonymous class implementing Runnable.

You can achieve the same effect by creating an anonymous object that implements
Runnable explicitly:

postponeComputation(1000, object : Runnable
	{ override fun run() {
		println(42)
	}
})

When you pass a lambda, an anonymous class is created

But there’s a difference. When you explicitly declare an object, a new instance is
created on each invocation. With a lambda, the situation is different: if the lambda
doesn’t access any variables from the function where it’s defined, the corresponding
anonymous class instance is reused between calls:

One instance of Runnable is created for the entire program

Therefore, the equivalent implementation with an explicit object declaration is the
following snippet, which stores the Runnable instance in a variable and uses it for every
invocation:

val runnable = Runnable { println(42) }

fun handleComputation() {
	postponeComputation(1000, runnable)
}

Compiled to a static variable; only one instance in the program, 
One object is used for every handleComputation call.

If the lambda captures variables from the surrounding scope, it’s no longer possible to
reuse the same instance for every invocation. In that case, the compiler creates a new object for every call and stores the values of the captured variables in that object. For
example, in the following function, every invocation uses a new
storing the id value as a field:

fun handleComputation(id: String)
	{ postponeComputation(1000)
	{ println(id) }
}

Captures the variable "id" in a lambda
Creates a new instance of Runnable on each handleComputation call

However, all this is for when dealing with Java
If you pass a lambda to the
Kotlin function that’s marked inline, no anonymous classes are created. And most of
the library functions are marked inline

A SAM constructor is a compiler-generated function that lets you perform an explicit
conversion of a lambda into an instance of a functional interface. You can use it in
contexts when the compiler doesn’t apply the conversion automatically. For example, if
you have a method that returns an instance of a functional interface, you can’t return a
lambda directly; you need to wrap it into a SAM constructor. Here’s a simple example:

fun createAllDoneRunnable(): Runnable
	{ return Runnable { println("All
		done!") }
	}
>>> createAllDoneRunnable().run()
All done!


The name of the SAM constructor is the same as the name of the underlying
functional interface

In addition to returning values, SAM constructors are used when you need to store a
functional interface instance generated from a lambda in a variable

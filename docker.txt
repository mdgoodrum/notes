A Docker image is a private filesystem, just for your container. It provides all the files and code your container will need. Running the docker build command creates a Docker image using the Dockerfile. This built image is in your machine's local Docker image registry.

cd doodle/cheers2019 &&
docker build -t sk8erfrom/cheers2019 .

Running a container launches your software with private resources, securely isolated from the rest of your machine.

docker run -it --rm sk8erfrom/cheers2019

Once you're ready to share your container with the world, push the image that describes it to Docker Hub.

docker login &&
docker push sk8erfrom/cheers2019
